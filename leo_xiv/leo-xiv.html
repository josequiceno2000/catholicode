            <h2>First Benediction "To the City (of Rome) and to the World" of The Holy Father Leo XIV, May 8th, 2025</h2>
            <p>This evening the Holy Father Leo XIV, preceded by the Cross, has appeared at the External Loggia of the Blessing of the Vatican Basilica to greet the people and impart the Apostolic Blesssing "Urbi et Orbi".</p>
            <p>Before the Blessing, the new Pope addressed the following words to the faithful:</p>
            <h3>Words of the Holy Father</h3>
            <p>Peace be with you all!</p>
            <p>Beloved brothers and sisters, this is the first greeting of the Risen Christ, the good shepherd who gave his life for God's flock. It is my own wish that this greeting of peace enter your hearts, reach into your families, to all people, wherever they are, all nations, the whole earth. Peace be with you!</p>
            <p>This is the peace of the Risen Christ, and unarmed peace and a disarming, humble and persevering peace. It comes from God, God who loves everyone unconditionally. We still keep in our ears that voice, weak yet ever courageous, of Pope Francis blessing Rome!</p>
            <p>In blessing Rome the Pope gave his blessing to the world, the whole world, that Easter morning. Allow me follow up on that same blessing: God loves us, God loves you all, and evil shall not previal! We are all in the hands of God. Therefore, without fear, hand in hand with God and with each other let us march onward. We are disciples of Christ. Christ goes before us. The world needs His light. Humanity needs Him as the bridge to become reunited to God and to his love. Help us too — and help each other — to build bridges, through dialogue, through encounter, uniting all of us to be one people, always at peace. Thank you Pope Francis!</p>
            <p>I would also like to thank above all my brother cardinals who have chosen me to be the Successor of Peter and walk together with you, as a Church united, always seeking peace, justice, always seeking to work as men and women faithful to Jesus Christ, without fear, to proclaim the Gospel, to be missionaries.</p>
            <p>I am a son of Saint Augustine, an Augustinian, who said 'For you I am a bishop; but with you I am a Christian". In this sense we can walk together towards that homeland that God has prepared for us.</p>
            <p>To the Church in Rome a special greeting! [<em>applause</em>] We must seek toghether how to be a missionary Church, a Church that builds bridges, creates dialogue, always open to receive — like this St. Peter's Square, with open arms everyone, everyone who needs our charity, our presence, our dialogue, and our love.</p>
            <p>And if you will permit me as well, a word, a greeting to all those, in a very special way, to my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru, where a faithful people has accompanied their bishop, have shared their faith and given so, so much to continue being the faithful Church of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>To all of you, brothers and sisters of Rome, from Italiy, from all over the world, we want to be a synodal Church, a Church that walks, a Church that always seeks peace, that always seeks charity, that always seeks to be close — especially to all who are suffering.</p>
            <p>Today is the day of the Supplication to Our Lady of Pompeii. Our Mother Mary wants always to walk with us, to be near, to help us with her intercession and love.</p>
            <p>Now I would like to pray together with you. Let us pray together for our new mission, for the whole Church, for peace in the world, and let us ask Mary, our Mother, for this special grace.</p>
            <p><em>Ave Maria</em>...</p>
